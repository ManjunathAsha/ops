= Build Instructions =

 # ==Checkout==
   Checkout OPS to a directory of your choice e.g. "C:\OPS", see Source tab.
 # ==Install Boost==
   Download pre-built binaries for boost 1.38 from http://www.boostpro.com/download
    * Under "Select Default Variants" in the installer choose the build versions of boost you need (depends on how you want to build and link OPS). If you dont know, select all.
    * Under "Choose Components", select at least the following (make sure you only select components for the compiler versions you need):
      # Boost header files
      # Boost !DateTime
      # Boost Filesystem
      # Boost Regex
      # Boost System
      # Boost Thread
    Hit next, and choose Installation Directory to be for example "C:\Program Files\boost\boost_1_38" and start installation.
 # ==Build OPS Core for C++ with Visual Studio ==
   Open 
    "C++\Visual C++\OPSCrossPlatformCppSolution\OPSCrossPlatformCppSolution.sln" 
   with Visual Studio. If you didn't install boost to "C:\Program Files\boost\boost_1_38" you need to repoint your include directories.
  Build the solution and verify it compiles alright (you will have some warnings).
 # ==Build OPS Core for Java with Netbeans 6.7 ==
   Open from Netbeans
   "Java\OPSJLib" and "Libs\!ConfigurationLib".
   First build !ConfigurationLib and then OPSJLib. Both should compile without errors.
 # ==Build OPS IDL Builder with Netbeans 6.7 ==
   Open from Netbeans "Tools\OPS IDL Builder NB", make sure you check Open Required Projects and Open as main project. Right click the main project and select "Build All". This will build several projects and output quite a lot of text in the output window. Make sure you scroll to the bottom of the output window and verify it says "BUILD SUCCESSFUL". Try the OPS IDL Builder by choosing "Run" on the main project (OPS IDL Builder NB).
