== What is IDL? ==
IDL stands for Interface Definition Language and is a common name for programming language neutral languages used in middlewares to enable support for multiple programming languages (E.g. C++ and Java).
In OPS the IDL language is very simple and is only used to define data classes (i.e. structs). Once a data class is defined in IDL, it can be “compiled” into the desired target programming languages that will be used in your distributed application.
The OPS IDL resembles simplified Java or C++, a simple data class could look as follows:

{{{
package samples;

class SimpleData
{
	int i;
	double d;
	string s;
}
}}}

== The OPS IDL Builder ==
To edit IDL files and to compile these files into target languages, OPS comes with a tool called OPS IDL Builder. The OPS IDL Builder can be seen as an IDE for OPS projects. The OPS IDL Builder looks as follows, with the sample code from above open in a sample project:

http://ops.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/idlcompiler.jpg

With the OPS IDL Compiler you create projects containing possibly multiple IDL files with all the different data types you use in your project. 
Compiled to C++, this is what would be generated from the SimpleData data type above:

{{{
//Auto generated OPS-code. DO NOT MODIFY!
#ifndef samples_SimpleData_h
#define samples_SimpleData_h

#include "OPSObject.h"
#include "ArchiverInOut.h"
#include <string>
#include <vector>

namespace samples {

class SimpleData :
	public ops::OPSObject
{
public:
	
    int i;
    double d;
    std::string s;

    SimpleData() : ops::OPSObject(),
        i(0),
        d(0)
    {
        OPSObject::appendType(std::string("samples.SimpleData"));
    }

    ///This method acceptes an ops::ArchiverInOut visitor which will serialize or deserialize an
    ///instance of this class to a format dictated by the implementation of the ArchiverInout.
    void serialize(ops::ArchiverInOut* archive)
    {
		ops::OPSObject::serialize(archive);
		archive->inout(std::string("i"), i);
		archive->inout(std::string("d"), d);
		archive->inout(std::string("s"), s);
    }

    ///Destructor: Note that all aggregated data and vectors are completely deleted.
    virtual ~SimpleData(void)
    {
    }
};

}

#endif
}}}

The IDL Compiler is also where you define your topics on which you will publish and subscribe to in your applications. This is done by creating a XML configuration file that looks something like this:

{{{
<root>
    <ops_config type = "DefaultOPSConfigImpl">
        <domains>
            <!-- Define a domain called FooDomain.-->
            <element type = "MulticastDomain">
                <domainID>SampleDomain</domainID>
                <domainAddress>234.5.6.8</domainAddress>
                <topics>
                    <!-- Define a Topic called SimpleTopic. -->
                    <element type = "Topic">
                        <name>SimpleTopic</name>
                        <port>8888</port>
                        <dataType>samples.SimpleData</dataType>
                    </element>
                </topics>
            </element>
        </domains>
    </ops_config>
</root>

}}}
