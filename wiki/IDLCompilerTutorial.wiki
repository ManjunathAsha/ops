#summary This section describes how and why you use the IDL Compiler to create the outline for a distributed OPS project.

== What is IDL? ==
IDL stands for Interface Definition Language and is a common name for programming language neutral languages used in middlewares to enable support for multiple programming languages (E.g. C++ and Java).
In OPS the IDL language is very simple and is only used to define data classes (i.e. structs). Once a data class is defined in IDL, it can be “compiled” into the desired target programming languages that will be used in your distributed application.
The OPS IDL resembles simplified Java or C++, a simple data class could look as follows:

{{{
package samples;

class SimpleData
{
	int i;
	double d;
	string s;
}
}}}
