Another use full feature when subscribing to a topic is to use something called Time Based Filter. This allows you to tell the OPS core that your subscriber wants get data with at least a certain time spparation. This is usful in situations when you want to subscribe to topics that are published on with a high rate but your are only interested in the same data at a lower rate.

This saves both CPU power and simplifies your data handling.

Setting up a Time Based Filter QoS is easy and is done in the same way in both C++ and Java. The following shows how subscribe to a topic and only get samples at a maximum rate of 1Hz:

{{{
sub.setTimeBasedFilterQoS(1000) //Minimum separation between to samples in milliseconds
}}}
