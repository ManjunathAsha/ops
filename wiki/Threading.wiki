The threading model of OPS differs bit between C++ and Java implementations and will therefore be described one by one in the follower of this page:

= Threading Model C++ =

The C++ implementation of OPS uses boost.asio as the core fore its communication and thread model. boost.asio allows for asynchronous socket io and enables each ops.Participant  to run on a single thread. This thread asynchronously handle receptions of datagrams, handles deadline timeouts and timers that periodically fire up.

More than doing work in the core of OPS, this thread also occasionally finds it way in to your application code. This happens when your are notified of new data or deadlineTimeouts via listeners. Is important to understand that if you hold up the executing thread in such a listener callback, this will affect the whole participant. Listener callbacks should always do as little work as possible, if you need to do more heavy work, consider polling the subscriber instead or transfer your work to another working thread.


= Threading Model Java =

In Java, each Topic yields one thread that waits on the socket for new data to arrive. Deadline timeouts are checked by another thread common for the whole participant.


To understand more about the threads of OPS, please have a look at the developer documentation and the source code it self.
