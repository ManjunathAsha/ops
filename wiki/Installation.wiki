=OPS â€“ Installation (Windows XP)=

 # ==Set up your environment==
   Make sure you have a Java SE Development Kit (JDK, version 5 or higher) installed on
   your system. The tools you use to create systems with OPS are all running in Java and
   use the Java compiler to generate pre-compiled code to use for debugging. If you know 
   you will only use OPS for C++ and C# and do not need any debugging capabilities, it may
   be sufficient to only have a Java runtime environment installed. It is strongly
   recommended to install a JDK though.
   If you do not have a JDK installed on your system follow these steps:
   #	Download the latest JDK from java.sun.com, http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/
   #	Install it, you will need administrator rights on your system.
   #	When installed, add the newly created directory
        "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk.jdk.version\bin" to your user environment variable
        called path, you can do this without being an administrator of your system.
 
 # ==Download OPS==
   Go to [http://code.google.com/p/ops/download/list Download] to get the latest binaries
   for the languages you want to use OPS with. You will also need the latest Tools.
