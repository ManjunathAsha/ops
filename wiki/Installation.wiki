=OPS â€“ Installation (Windows XP)=

==Set up your environment==
   Make sure you have a Java SE Development Kit (JDK, version 5 or higher) installed on
   your system. The tools you use to create systems with OPS are all running in Java and
   use the Java compiler to generate pre-compiled code to use for debugging. If you know 
   you will only use OPS for C++ and C# and do not need any debugging capabilities, it may
   be sufficient to only have a Java runtime environment installed. It is strongly
   recommended to install a JDK though.
   If you do not have a JDK installed on your system follow these steps:
   #	Download the latest JDK from java.sun.com, http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/
   #	Install it, you will need administrator rights on your system.
   #	When installed, add the newly created directory
        "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk.jdk.version\bin" to your user environment variable
        called path, you can do this without being an administrator of your system.
==Download OPS Binaries==
   Go to [http://code.google.com/p/ops/downloads/list Downloads] to get the latest 
   binaries for the languages you want to use OPS with. You will also need the
   latest Tools. Unpack all the zip files you downloaded directly under a common 
   director (E.g. C:\OPS\, this directory will be refered to as OPS_DIR from here on).

   After unpacking the zip files, make sure your directory structure look as follows:

      * OPS_DIR
         * C++
         * Examples
         * Java
         * Tools

   Or, go [BuildInstructions here], if you are interested in building OPS 
   from source.
   ----
==Run the Tools and the examples==
   Open OPS IDL Builder, from OPS_DIR\Tools\OPS IDL Builder\bin\ops_idl_builder_nb.exe
   Use the OPS IDL Builder to open TestAll sample IDL project (File->Open
   Project...browse to OPS_DIR\Examples\TestAll, check open as main project and
   click Open Project.). 

   Once open, expand "TestAll" and "testall" package folder and checkout the IDL files    
   making up this example.

   When ready, build the project by hitting the blue build hammer or right click your 
   project and select "Build".

   When you build your project, a dos prompt will pop up showing you the progress of 
   building java jar files. This output is quite verbose and it can be hard to see if it 
   succeds or not. Checkout the following video to se what it should look like. If it does 
   not work, it is probably because you have not put your Java JDK on your path correctly 
   and it will output something like "javac is not a command or program"
