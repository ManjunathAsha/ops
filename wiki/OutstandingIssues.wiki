= Outstanding Issues=

OPS is far from complete. Outstanding Issues and shortcomings include:

 * C++ Core does only work for Windows (Visual Studio Compilers)
 * Documentation is Poor, there is no API docs
 * UDP and TCP Transport are not fully implemented and functional
 * C# support has been dropped until API:s stabalize
 * OPS has no active community (is maintained by one person only a the time being)
 * OPS need more users
 * Java Performance could improve, it is now suffering a bit from C++ optimizations, this is especially true for large messages.

To solve these and other issues and make OPS better, help is required. Please file Issue reports and send in Patches.
