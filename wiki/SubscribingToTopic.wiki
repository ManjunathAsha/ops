Given a IDL project FooProject with a data type FooData used by a topic FooTopic on a domain FooDomain this is how you set up a subscrption and receive data:

== Java ==
There are two basic ways of subscribing to data in OPS, by regestering a listener that will benotified when new data arrives, or by polling the subscriber for data at any time.

No matter what way you use to receive the data the setup of a subscription is always the same and look as follows:

{{{
Participant participant = Participant.getInstance("FooDomain");
participant.addTypeSupport(new FooProject.FooProjectTypeFactory());

Topic topic = participant.createTopic("FooTopic");

FooDataSubscriber sub = new FooDataSubscriber(topic);

}}}
