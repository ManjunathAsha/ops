#summary This page describes how to build and run the OPS Examples in C++ and Java

=Building Examples=

Under OPS_HOME/Examples, you will find an example called !TestAll and a corresponding C++ implementation called !TestAllC++Test.

Open TestAllC++Test.sln under !TestAllC++Test and build and run it to see that your OPS installation works correctly for C++.
If you have boost in another place than "C:\Program Files\boost_1_38", make sure to alter the include and library directories to make the sample compile alright.
