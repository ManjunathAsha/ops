== Hello World Example ==


This page will show you how to write an application that sends a Hello World message with OPS. It will guide you through the steps of writing a Data class in IDL, defining a Topic configuration and implement publishers and subscribers in both C++ and Java.

Make sure you have understand the [BasicConcepts Basic Concepts] before continuing.

First we need a Data type to carry our Hello World message. We define this Data class using OPS IDL (See also [IDLLanguage IDL Language] and [DLCompilerTutorial OPS IDL Builder]):

{{{
package hello;

class HelloData
{
    /*This string holds hello messages.*/
    string helloString;
}
}}}

OK, so now we have a Data class to carry a string where we can put our Hello World message.

Now we also need a Topic to publish our Data class on. We define the Topic in a XML file that we call ops_config.xml like this (See also [OpsConfig OPS Config]):

{{{
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!--
 Description:
 A template ops_config.xml file, this file shall be put on run directory of all applications that wants to use these topics.
-->
<root>
    <ops_config type = "DefaultOPSConfigImpl">
        <domains>

            <!-- The one and only domain in our Hello World example -->
            <element type = "MulticastDomain">
                <domainID>HelloDomain</domainID>
                <domainAddress>234.5.6.8</domainAddress>
                <topics>
                    <!-- The one and only topic in our Hello World example -->
                    <element type = "Topic">
                        <name>HelloTopic</name>
                        <port>12000</port>
                        <dataType>hello.HelloData</dataType>
                    </element>
                    
                </topics>
            </element>

        </domains>
    </ops_config>
</root>
}}}

As you can see we specify one Topic called HelloTopic and attach this Topic to a Domain that we call HelloDomain. We choose a port (12000) and a domainAddress (234.5.6.8) to communicate on.
